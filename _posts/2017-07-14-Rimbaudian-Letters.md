<div><p>T</p></div>here is an element of Rimbaudian’s (born Armand Jakobsson) record that brings you back to Grant’s opening sample on *Cranks* (fellow Lobster Theremin artist under his DJ Seinfeld alias):

>“Dance music is not just dance music anymore - it’s for the head now, you can see that in the sort of good creative albums now, they’ve got a lot more thought about them than usual, ya know? Let’s go and dance and have some fun, ya know? It’s good to do that - but it’s a level of generation, of my generation, obviously because I listened to music a little bit deeper, not as thin as usual… [it was] music of the mind…”

<p class="poopquote">From “Mainstream Belief”</p>


This is a great way to introduce the thought process behind *Cranks*, but to put <u>all</u> house music into these groupings would be naive; not all non-intellectual music is simplistic, and not all “fun” music has to be devoid of industry. For context, this is a world where David Guetta <del>and his army of producers</del> create scientifically-perfected sounds that make his dance music feel like an ongoing laboratory experiment of how to get the essential “house sound” out of every speaker. But “Mainstream Belief” fails to establish that in many ways dance music has lost its raw, sincere, emotional edge; music has to make you feel, but feelings are not well composed, or cleanly compressed. Sure, Guetta still makes others under-35 remember and feel the *Snapchat Experience*<sup>TM</sup> (at a local bar or Ultra Music Festival equally). But his songs hardly tell a unique story; there is simply no candor in his music. In contrast, Rimbaudian warps us back to a time when house wasn’t only enjoyed as a larger political/social commentary, or the musical scene appropriate for your vodka bombs - this is honest house music; it isn’t for all and the Sweden-via-Barcelona producer’s niche won't instantly woo those who enjoy the concept on paper.

With the revival of tape/analog-influenced dance-music production, Rimbaudian flirts with the style throughout this record, but never fully embraces it (the way Mall Grab or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6eu1Wb8CVE">DJ Seinfeld</a> does). With titles like “I Said Goodbye To Dreams Of You At The Shore”, it seems he is taking a page out of <a href="https://inlovewithaghost.bandcamp.com/album/discography-2015">In the Ghost Of’s</a> *wear-your-song-title-on-your-sleeve* book; make your music like an open manual about yourself, even if it’s not that much more revealing than a title like “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AWIqXzvX-U">Rhubarb</a>".

(It is also worth mentioning Jakobsson’s project’s namesake, drawing from the french poet Arthur Rimbaud. It is beyond a doubt a stretch to associate the thematic content of the revered proto-surrealist with the content of Jakobsson’s work, other than at the surface level. For example, his previous project, *Illuminations EP*, had borrowed the name of Rimbaud’s 1886 work <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminations_(poetry_collection)">Les Illuminations</a></i>. With the first track, using the phrase “beat u” as though the narrator is a physical subwoofer pumping the kick drum into your face, it’s hard to imagine there are many similarities to Rimbaud.)

There is a value in viewing *Letters* as a series of paragraphs in a letter written to an ex-lover. The opener, "She Taught Me How To Love", is the most well-produced of the 4-track EP; tempered and mature, with a clear mastery of music production. It’s clean, precise use of a low-pass filter to surge the synths back and forth, in-and-out of the presence of the track, illustrate that Rimbaudian has the composure of more mainstream artists. Starting your record/letter off with a serious track/paragraph makes sense; you rewrite the same opening so many times that you edit out yourself, making the delivery robotic and sterile upon completion. On another record, this would be a fault, but here it is part of his theme. He tried to steady his hand with his "best track" (or his best opening paragraph in this case) but it feels unnatural, he can't control his emotions just yet, making the headstrong title look as fake as the "real man" album cover.

Then the *feels* start pouring out, as “Drop It On Em” is as emotional as “emotional house” can be. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CzCg_lJa7o">Janet Jackson’s vocals swirl</a>, the mix awash with hazy mids, he replaces the crisp highs and lows with his overflowing feelings in the middle. If Rimbaud’s *A Season in Hell* is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Season_in_Hell#Interpretation">dialogue between a wide-eyed child and a pessimistic older man</a>, then “Drop It On Em” is the rejected older man. The gradual, slightly repetitive intro goes on just long enough to make you feel antsy, and quickly all the snippets of “conversation” (Janet Jackson's pitch-bent vocals and a man saying affirmative responses “Uh-huh, ok, ah”), build a dialogue. Then, Janet Jackson’s fuller vocal samples cut the pleasantries:

>“I'm feelin high cuz I'm outta control tonight / <br>
(Feelin high don't wanna stop) / … <br>
I'll make him mine in time / … <br>
He won't wanna stop” <br>

<p class="poopquote">From "Go Deep"</p>

It feels as though the writer is reminding what the lover said on the first night they met: it’s sincere, even touching, but ultimately boyish in its ability to not recognize that the song is about Janet Jackson making him her’s, even if the emotion during their meet is reciprocated. The faster tempo, the pulsing kick-drum recall dance floor romances, while the production quality adds a layer of opacity, obscuring what actually happened during the encounter until it’s a bunch of misinterpreted promises and warm feelings. This is as close to a dancefloor track that Rimbaudian comes, and it’s ok that it doesn’t even fulfill that.

His confession, "I Would Do Everything I Did Again And Again" is when he can no longer hold back. Without even bothering with a build-up, the song drops you into the middle of itself (minus the bass/sub-bass synth). With Aaliyah-like vocals and a gorgeous reverb-filled grand piano that tumbles over itself, you leave the dance floor chasing after your lover with a melancholic and desperate plea. Towards the end of the piece, everything has been stripped away until you are only left with the piano and the vocals, and then *again*, the song picks up where it left you a minute earlier: you believed you moved closer to your goal, only to be placed back where you started. While the title alludes to the ups and downs of the lovers’ encounter, you feel inclined to pity rather than emphasize with the narrator.

That leaves “I Said Goodbye To Dreams Of You At The Shore,” the weakest of the songs on the album. A pleasant, tropical-influenced closing track, this fails to make as strong a statement as the previous tracks. To some extent, this is the purpose of the song: if the author left the dream of their relationship, then it no longer colors their life. It cleverly reinterprets the main melody from the opening track, stripping it down and making it more melancholic. There is a screeching synth around 2:30 that briefly colors the mix, adding the layer that their relationship will continue to sporadically appear in the wavy palms of somewhere far-off, but will disappear as quickly as you noticed it. The <a href="http://www.whosampled.com/sample/486444/Rimbaudian-I-Said-Goodbye-to-Dreams-of-You-at-the-Shore-Big-Moses-Kenny-Bobien-Brighter-Days/">Brighter Days sample</a> that closes off the track is tasteful, and redeems the lackluster middle, with the unreal falsetto of Kenny Bobian adding another vulnerability to the mix. The warped whispers of “Oh love is on the way / Don’t you stray...” along with the wailing pull you further into his uneasy dream, as though you are still waiting on the shore for his lover to come back.

Returning back to Grant’s “Mainstream Belief”, it closes with another quote, highlighting that dance music was one of the first music genres to become “faceless,” and therefore colorless and genderless. If Jakobsson’s multiple aliases and continuing references to Arthur Rimbaud shed any light, it's that truly emotionally fulfilling music is not limited to one genre, nor one location, nor one project. There are few dance records that will tell such a complete story without lyrics (the titles do assist in filling in the blanks), and other artists should take note. With listed contributors including Scuba, Axel Boman, J Rocc, Catz ‘n Dogz, Joe Goddard, Bodhi, and Fred P among others, it shows why Rimbaudian/DJ Seinfeld has been taken seriously. I’m not only excited for future releases of Rimbaudian, but all his other aliases as well.
