To some, house music is a sophisticated art form that involves the appreciation of the subtle. Mastery of this art is about knowing sublime production, that resonates with someone's soul for picking the right tone, the right repetitive melody. As the production builds, a swirl of ecstasy comparable to a sexual explosion takes place inside a listeners' ear. But rather than your heart beat speeding up, having an orgasm, and chain smoking to keep the endorphins floating around for long enough, house keeps the 4 on the floor to keep your heart beating as long as you don't go deaf, or run out of batteries on your cellphone.

Then there's the other viewpoint. House is a rudimentary art form that reveals the naivety of its creator and its inability to escape the reMost of the song is revealed within these first 30 seconds, and then is repeated until drug addicts listening enter a trance and forget about their substance abuse habits. How many bass drum hits can you hear until your ears bleed, and you develop a category 5 migraine?

Rimbaudian composes adolescent depictions of love, gratitude, and ego, transforming them into what may appear to some as rudimentary house. With more established EDM names looking for that grandiose scale of a lead synthesizer, the perfect bass drum compression and scooped mixed to deliver maximum "tick tick, followed by that bump." Rimbaudian looks back into a time when not only were his feelings frivolous and infantile (with titles like "I Said Goodbye To Dreams Of You At The Shore", it seems he is taking a page after [In Love With a Ghost](https://inlovewithaghost.bandcamp.com/album/discography-2015)), and his mixes reflect the same. Opening track tries to be serious and mature, with a cleaner production and more standard track pattern, but they fail by revealing too much too quickly. You instantly know his hand within 30-seconds of the song. On another record, this would be a fault, but here it is his message. Like "Letters" (borrowed from the title of the album) to a current/former lover, he tried to steady his hand with his "best track" (or his best opening paragraph in this case.) but it's rushed, he can't control his emotions just yet, making the headstrong title track looking like as fake as the "real man" album cover. 

Then the feels start pouring out. Drop it on 'em is a sincere attempt at producing "emotional house." He tries to stunt, but the mix is too washed, the hazy noise of the mids filling the highs and lows with waves of his overflowing feelings.

Next, "I Would Do Everything I Did Again And Again" is his confession; He no longer can hold back.
