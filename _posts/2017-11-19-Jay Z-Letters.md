**Released:** 30 June 2017 <br>
**Label:** Roc Nation / UMG (New York, USA) <br>
**Novelty:** No one is like JAY-Z, and No I.D.’s sampling is sometimes, stellar. It has clever twists on a standard hip-hop record, but doesn’t reinvent the mold. <br>
**Longevity:** 1 month. In comparison to his older catalogue, JAY-Z’s new work won’t last. Some of No I.D.’s work will be an inspiration for other producers, but between the awkward bars and some awkward mixing, this was never worth revisiting unless you are a tortured writer trying to write a cohesive review. <br>
**When to Listen:** Too intellectual for a party, too much slog for serious listening commitment, late afternoons in a playlist? <br>
**Moods:** Keeps-you-busy, substitute-for-coffee, feeling old school on a new school block. <br>
**Similar Listening:** Kanye West, Joe Budden <br>
**Reaching:** J. Cole, Big Punisher <br>
**Stand-out Tracks:** ““The Story of O.J.” / “Marcy Me” / “Legacy” <br>
**What to Skip:** “Bam (feat. Damian Marley)” / “Moonlight” <br>
**Do the Singles Highlight the Strengths of the Record:** Yes, and then there’s “Bam”.
**Accessibility:** I would hazard that if you aren’t already familiar with JAY-Z, you probably aren’t familiar with rap/hip-hop as a whole; this especially won’t turn you on to him, or the genre at all. There are easter eggs for HipHopHeads to agonize over, and pleasant songs for the more casual fan. <br>
**Where to get:** <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/4-44/1256675529"><i class="fa fa-apple fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> <br>
**Quality Preference:** Surprisingly if you love this record, get the CD/Tidal recording. It comes with bonus tracks and the mixing seems better than iTunes (cleaner lows). <br>

<div><p>W</p></div>here would rap be if it weren’t for JAY-Z? Nas might still have the confidence to make decent records, BIGGIE would’ve been the undisputed king of New York rap, Kanye might be an obscure beat maker treasured like Fat Jon the Ample Soul Musician, and the landscape of the genre would be for the worse.

Where would rap be if *4:44* wasn’t released? Or *Vol. 3… Life and Times of Sean Carter*? Or *Magna Carta Holy Grail*? Or *Unfinished Business*? To put *4:44* in the category of some of his less acclaimed works is harsh, but this is the nature of the world’s greatest hustler: if you know what JAY-Z is capable of, how can you settle for *4:44*? Where would writers be without cheesy rhetorical devices?

If you turn your brain off and tune in and out of the record, you would swear something feels off, you would never be able to put your finger on it; production, lyrics, thematic consistency, the album cover. What is JAY-Z trying to say? What paradigm do we look at his record in light of the revelations present on Beyoncé’s *Lemonade*: his failures trying to give “music back to musicians” on Tidal, or his lackluster follow-up to the tour de force on *Watch the Throne*? More importantly, no matter what paradigm, who is Sean really?

If the existential crisis-turned-song “Kill Jay-Z” is to be taken at face value, this is the death of JAY-Z/Jay Z’s ego. <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/jay-zs-name-the-hyphen-is-back-and-now-its-in-all-caps/">Welcome Back the hyphen now</a>, everything is re-reborn (a la Snoop Lion back to Snoop Dogg). But JAY-Z didn’t just change this record’s cataloged artist, much probably to the ire of Roc Nation’s parent company Universal Music Group, and then having to scratch their head at the extra paperwork in front of them. As my iTunes-library-having-a-fit attests to, iTunes still has him listed as JAY Z. Yet it’s not just Magna Carta that’s listed there, all of his records that are available on iTunes (excluding 4:44) still say JAY Z. It means that at one point Jay’s representatives told iTunes to go back and update the naming scheme. If the opening track is about letting go of your ego, accepting who you are, Jay did it for a meme alone. On Tidal it still lists him as JAY-Z for his whole catalogue, but the iTunes mistake reveals that Jay thought he could retroactively change who he was, and how people perceived him.

That makes no sense.

Not that Snoop Dogg is a model to emulate (cooking & game shows excluded), but he didn’t re-label his old works for his new persona; that was *old* Snoop, then it was *new* Snoop, now it’s *Martha Stewart* Snoop. Each is a period in his life, they fit molds not because he assigned them to be, they just are. It seems Sean can’t accept that people saw him in a certain way (his wife included), and he thinks that cosmetic changes will signify a new awakening. <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/awakening/summary/">Drowning yourself in the ocean might do this</a>, but removing a hyphen will hardly dent his massive ego.

Even if a minor point, it illustrates my problem with this record as a whole: Sean is trying to be too many things at once.
* He’s one of the few rappers who has earned “street cred”, yet holds a net-worth so high that it’s hard to consider him street.
* He yearns for black entrepreneurial/generational wealth abilities for all (“Few years later, that shit worth eight million / I can't wait to give this shit to my children” or as he says later on the record “Legacy legacy legacy / Black excellence baby”), yet laments business mistakes that would’ve netted him more personally (“I could’ve bought a place in Dumbo before it was Dumbo / For like 2 million”.)

There’s nothing inherently wrong with the practice, but the way Jay claims to speak for a whole race on the matter is where it gets messy.

>“You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America?”

  Usury?

Take the (in)famous line for example. I understand this line is to draw attention to the <a href="https://listen.tidal.com/album/77563667/track/77563668/">normalization of certain racial/ethnic stereotypes while becoming defensive over others</a>, mocking the hypocrisy. To its credit, it is well thought out given the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM7lw0Ovzq0">accompanying video</a> that attempts a subtle commentary on the racism within Disney’s cartoons. But “this is how they did it”? That’s no punchline, no mind blowing thought that warps your sense of what’s right and wrong. It ends up making the previous line stand out as trying too hard. For a line that defined a lot of the context of the song, you would think JAY-Z would put *more effort* into its creation.

And effort is the word that someone might return to when they relisten to this record. Part of the appeal of Jay’s rhymes are his creamy flow; they feel “original” because he records and then leaves mid recording session, <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1574995/jay-z-behind-the-rhymes-hov-reveals-why-he-hasnt-written-down-lyrics-in-a-decade/">having never written a word down beforehand</a>. It gives his rap more of its off-the-cuff feel, and is more true to the freestyle feel that made JAY-Z’s famous. But between Drake’s ghostwriters, the rebirth of rap groups like Brockhampton, and the <a href="https://www.complex.com/covers/kendrick-lamar-interview-turn-the-page-2014-cover-story/">image of Kendrick writing on a typewriter for his flows</a>, JAY-Z looks like a fossil. It stands in contrast to No I.D’s production, which obviously was labored over intensely for years (unfortunately perverted by Jimmy Douglass’ mixing). See “Caught Their Eyes” at 2:00, Sean’s delivery is suddenly removed from the weird vocal filter, gearing it more for a cheap beat some SoundCloud producer whipped up for a Friday night battle.

There’s also “Bam”, which might go down as one of the most annoying-try-hard beats I’ve ever heard. I don’t worship Kanye, but man when the beat switch up happens through “Famous,” it blew my mind. I shivered. Who knew Sister Nancy’s “Bam Bam” could sound like this? What divine inspiration do you need to reimagine it like this?

Then there’s No I.D.’s version, which makes it sound like a live, dub-mix with too many pitch-bent, trigger presses of an Ableton Live setup. Hearing her "voice" as such haunts me in my dreams. Also who dragged Damian Marley <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/14/140b6d2ae5882ed01f2b5e86730a8678daa18ea281f82ae0d839a41fe343ba0e.jpg">out of a classroom</a>?

To keep breaking down each individual song and why there are issue with them would take an eternity, and attention spans are too short, much like how some will forget this record exists in a few months. On the plus side, “Marcy Me” is silky smooth, and “Legacy” has its moments, so there’s no need to rip apart this record ruthlessly. It deserves praise, but it doesn’t deserve to be listed in a <a href="https://www.factmag.com/2017/09/30/best-albums-july-september-2017/amp/">top 25 record of the quarter</a>.

The idea of JAY-Z reinventing/humbling himself is applaudable, but this isn’t an Antony/Anohni reveal, which added an interesting subplot to her 2016’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopelessness_(album)/">Hopelessness</a>. If this is the future of JAY-Z’s material, look forward to hearing that one good song on *blonded radio* once per year (in this case “Marcy Me”).

**Epilogue, as of January 2nd, 2019**

It's funny reading this a year later, as some of my predictions about this album came true (at least for me).

On a more personal note, it's hard working up the courage to admit you let projects/dreams/aspirations slide. I started a job full-time in October 2017, and did not balance the work/life commitment as much as I wanted to. Over a year later, I finally put a few quick editing touches and published this.

I wanted this article to go another 2000 words, but if I don't put a nail in the coffin on this article it would haunt me forever, and it would never be published. Going forward, I hope to write shorter and more frequent articles.

Here's to a better 2019, and no more *"I'll do it next week"*.
