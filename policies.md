**know-fi** is a music-blog dedicated to writing music reviews without using a linear rating systems (ex. 0-10).

Rather than describing songs as having *[warm synth tones](https://youtu.be/ZGMALkWKKaw?t=114)*, know-fi will help readers understand why songs sound the way they sound. Alongside album reviews, know-fi writes about trends in the music industry, as well as other music-related opinion pieces.
